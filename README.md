- Prompt: "Generate a TaskCard component with props for title, priority, dueDate, and status. Include proper TypeScript types and Tailwind styling."
- Create reusable UI components using AI-generated code with consistent design patterns

**API Route Generation**
- Generate Express.js routes with proper error handling and validation
- Prompt: "Create a REST API endpoint for updating task status with Prisma ORM, Zod validation, and proper error handling"
- Use AI to scaffold database models and relationships in Prisma schema

**Database Schema Design**
- AI-assisted Prisma schema generation based on feature requirements
- Prompt: "Design a Prisma schema for a task management system with users, tasks, habits, and analytics tables"

### 🧪 Testing Support

**Unit Test Generation**
- Generate comprehensive test suites for React components
- Prompt: "Create unit tests for the TaskForm component covering form validation, submission, and error states using React Testing Library"
- AI-generated integration tests for API endpoints
- Prompt: "Generate integration tests for the task CRUD operations using Supertest, including authentication and authorization"

**Test Data Generation**
- Use AI to create realistic test fixtures and mock data
- Generate edge case scenarios for testing error handling

### 📡 Schema-Aware or API-Aware Generation

**OpenAPI Specification Integration**
- Generate API client code from OpenAPI specs using AI
- Prompt: "Generate TypeScript client code from this OpenAPI specification for the task management API"
- Create API documentation with examples using AI
- Auto-generate request/response types from database schemas

**Database-Aware Code Generation**
- Generate Prisma queries and mutations based on schema relationships
- Prompt: "Create a Prisma query to fetch user tasks with related habits and analytics data, including proper pagination"
- AI-assisted database migration scripts

### 📚 Documentation & Context-Aware Techniques

**Inline Documentation**
- AI-generated JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Prompt: "Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation to this analytics calculation function, including parameter descriptions and return value examples"
- Auto-generate README sections for new features

**Context-Aware Development**
- Feed file trees and current codebase context to AI for better suggestions
- Use git diffs to generate meaningful commit messages
- AI-assisted code refactoring with full context understanding

## 🛠️ Plan for In-Editor/PR Review Tooling

### Primary Tool: Cursor
- **Code Completion**: Advanced AI-powered autocomplete for TypeScript, React, and Node.js
- **Code Generation**: Generate entire functions and components from natural language descriptions
- **Refactoring**: AI-assisted code improvements and optimizations
- **Debugging**: AI-powered error analysis and solution suggestions

### Code Review: CodeRabbit
- **Automated PR Reviews**: AI-generated code review comments focusing on:
  - Code quality and best practices
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Performance optimizations
  - TypeScript type safety
- **Commit Message Generation**: AI-generated conventional commit messages
- **Documentation Updates**: Automatic detection of code changes requiring documentation updates

### Workflow Integration
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: AI-powered linting and formatting
- **PR Templates**: AI-generated PR descriptions with change summaries
- **Release Notes**: Automated changelog generation from commit history

## 📝 Sample Prompts

### Code Generation Prompt
```
Generate a React component called HabitTracker that displays a weekly calendar grid. 
Each day should show habit completion status with a checkbox. Include:
- TypeScript interfaces for habit data
- Tailwind CSS styling with hover effects
- Props for habits array and onToggle callback
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Responsive design for mobile devices
```

### Testing Prompt
```
Create a comprehensive test suite for the TaskPriorityCalculator utility function.
The function takes a task object with dueDate, importance, and urgency properties.
Tests should cover:
- Normal priority calculation scenarios
- Edge cases (past due dates, null values)
- Boundary conditions (same day, far future dates)
- Integration with the priority enum values
Use Vitest and include proper test descriptions and assertions.
```
